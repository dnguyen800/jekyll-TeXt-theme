I started this website as a way to document and share my knowledge of home automation and findings ~ with friends and interested parties. ~ When researching for ~ cohesive home automation solutions, I found the ~ product reviews, articles, forums  and ~ information I was reading ~ were either too basic or too advanced for my level, or only contained a piece of information I needed. Everything was scattered.

So I set out to create a website that had ~.  free ~ of ads and other biases.

### Doorbell Camera
**PUblished on: xx/xx/2019**

**Competitors in this space:** Nest, Rng, Secuisafe, Laview, 

I’ve personally tested the following:
- Nest Hello 

### Overview
I’ve installed the Nest Hello doorbell cameras for a few friends and they all love it—I secretly believe it is because of the ability to spy on passerbys. The biggest selling point for me is the piece of mind knowing when and where my package was delivered. While the camera may not stop package theft altogether, it at least makes your house less of a target.

Before installing a camera, it’s important to be aware of the rules and regulations regarding cameras and external installations. Living in an HOA neighborhood means you likely need approval before installing anything on the outside of your home.

Installation of doorbell cameras requires more planning, particularly with wired cameras. Consider the location and angle of the doorbell, and whether your home is equipped to support a wired doorbell.  There are camera solutions for nearly every scenario, though it may require a battery-powered camera.

#### Considerations before buying a doorbell amera

- Check with your HOA before installing any hardware outside your house.
- Check with household members about installing any indoor cameras. Privacy should be respected, after all.
- A good wireless network is needed to avoid wireless range issues. See my router recommendation.
- Check an online compatibility checker like Nest as not all homes are compatible with wired doorbell cameras. Wireless ones (like the Ring 2) can be installed anywhere.
- Cameras have decent viewing angles, but check that your doorbell location is ideal for a camera. 

#### What you get with a doorbell camera

- Know when your packages are delivered, and potentially stolen.
- Know when household members arrive and leave home.
- Send a message to your Chromecast speakers when someone is at the door.
- Receive phone notification when someone arrives at the door. 
- Continuous recording is useful when tracking suspicious neighborhood activity.

My personal experience with the Nest Hello camera is that it is reliable at sending timely notifications, but requires a monthly fee to get any real use out of it. Wi-Fi cloud cameras have a lot of points of failure (poor Wi-Fi performance, slow upload speed, crap servers) but Nest gets most of it right. I recommend it for the continuous recording, timely alerts and a reliable mobile app. Alerts are sent to my phone within seconds, and recordings are available within a minute or two of the event. Viewing live footage takes only a few seconds too. Did I mention how quick it is to view an alert?

#### The Problems
There is a Home/away Assist feature on the Nest app, but I found it doesn’t work reliably. There were a few times when I received an alert and opened the app to see my roommate watching TV in the living room. I’ve done my own testing of the feature (Home Assistant integration gives you access to this data) and found it can take hours for Nest to update to Home or Away status.

An option to store recorded videos locally will likely never come, as every company loves subscription revenue. Power-over-ethernet (PoE) is not an option either; it’s either wireless or nothing with the Nest doorbell.

One surprising omission with the Nest Hello package is the lack of a wall plate. Without it, the doorbell area is exposed and the doorbell install looks unprofessional. To deal with this issue, I used the Elago wall plate and can confirm it covers up the hole nicely.

#### Installation & Smart Home Integration
The wiring is easy, though first follow the Nest compatibility checker to see if your house supports wired doorbells. The hardest part of the install is physically mounting the doorbell onto a hard surface. I had to use a hammer drill and a pair of earplugs to get the job done, though I definitely annoyed some neighbors in the process.

There isn’t any usable integration with Home Assistant and SmartThings, but I think it’s better to use the Nest app to watch videos.

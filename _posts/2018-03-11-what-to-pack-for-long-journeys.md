I don't believe that backpackers ~. Either they buy very expensive and lightweight equipment, wear tights all the time, 
don't mind the smell of their BO. ~They are either not being completely honest about the negatives ~ or are making some large compromises. 
To me, it does not matter whether I can fit a week's worth of clothing into a backpack. Being able to pack and unpack efficiently is key to a less stressful trip.

There is nothing wrong with being overly cautious and overpacking on the first few trips, especially if you are concerned about cost and don't want to repurchase
things you already have. Just observe which items you frequently use and learn to live without the rest. If you don't get cold easily, a neck

I'll start off with the items I found to be invaluable on my trips.

Proper way to fold clothing:
I don't know the most efficient way to pack clothing, but I mix of Marie Kondo's folding methods (illustrated in ~~~) and rolling. Someone told me that rolling is the most efficient way. 

Essential Items I cannot live without:
- Uniqlo sealable packets: The packets used to seal Uniqlo t-shirts can be re-used to store stanky underwear and keep the smell from spreading to your clean clothes. 
Easy to bring along on trips. I use them to store my dirty and clean laundry in the same storage cubes for easy organization and checklist.
- 7 pairs of non-cotton boxer briefs: You can bring twice as number of non-cotton briefs than cotton. This saves so much space. The Uniqlo brand is great,
 though I also buy whatever is available at Marshalls. The hiking briefs like ~~~ give me major wedgies, so I don't recommend them.
- 
- Organization cubes (any brand): These don't save any space in your backpack, but cut down on my packing/unpacking time that ~. Totes also helps me identify if I forgot any clothing as I always arrange my clothing the same way in each cube
- REI day pack: This is a must, so that you can carry your essential items as carry-on luggage. You will never carry your hiking backpack 
with you during the day, so you need this. I've been using the REI day pack and it earns my highest recommendation. Very portable but 
sturdy material. No tears in the fabric during my last few trips. Uniqlo and others sell collapsible backpacks, but the material is too 
weak to hold up for moderate use.

- hiking 45-55L backpack: I'm using a 65L North Face backpack and unless you are planning to camp, it is too large. 45-55L is perfect, along with a 15L day pack.


Electronics:
- A decent, but not expensive laptop or tablet w/ keyboard: I use a Dell Latitude 5175 that I bought on a whim, but it has served me well ~. It costs
$250 with a keyboard, so I don't worry about scratches or theft. The tablet is fast enough to support my inefficient  trip planning/research 
(20+ browser tabs). If you can't get a travel ~, use any laptop what you already have.
- A modern travel adapter with USB ports - At least 2.1A to charge new phones and tablets.
- SD card USB adapter
- 
- Logitech bluetooth mouse: My tablet's touchpad is terrible, so I use the Logitech ~~ mouse across my devices. It is large, so I don't recommend it unless you plan to blog or work remotely.
- Earphones (any pair): I use my reliable Apple earbuds~. Enough people in the world have iPhones now, so you don't 
have to worry that the white earbuds make you a target for theft.

Clothing:
Layers, layers, layers. Breathable. Waterproof. Aim for non-cotton. I know I sound like a Uniqlo ad but their long-sleeve shirts retain heat during the cold and stay cool during the summer.

Luckily Uniqlo is

Upper body:
- The lightest water and wind-proof jacket you can afford: Never, ever bring a heavy jacket unless you are going to sub-zero temperatures.
- Non-cotton long-sleeve shirts.

Lower Body:

- 3 pairs of pants (varies by season and region) you don't mind getting wet: You will deal with unexpected rain at some point, so you should invest a ~. DWR (durable water repellant?) 
- 7 pairs of non-cotton boxers
- 1 pair of thermals: this doubles as my pajamas and extra layer of warmth for colder regions
- 3 pairs hiking socks: ~ You need to test out these socks before committing, because some may keep your feet too warm and sweaty. I recommend hiking socks that just cover the ankle.

- the most compact, least expensive sandals you can find


Toiletries:

- 
- a lock: required at hostels



Items I no longer take with me:
- Water bottle: If you have the room to spare, bring one along. You can stuff your pills and other small toiletries to reduce space.
- Beanies, neck sleeves: If I'm in a cold climate, my hooded jacket provides the protection I need.
- Portable surge protector: You only need one AC outlet to charge your laptop, and your travel adapter should have a built-in USB port, so you don't need these anymore.
- Video games: During my international travels, I rarely used my Nintendo 3DS or Switch. I was busy travelling during the day and writing, researching or socializing at night.
 It also felt anti-social to play games in a hostel since very few are interested in playing games vs. exploring the cities. 
 Reading a book is a better alternativenot as anti-social and can spark some conversations with strangers if they can see what book you're reading.
- Bluetooth mouse

If you really want to play a game, your laptop should be enough.

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

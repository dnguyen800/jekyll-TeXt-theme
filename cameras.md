## Cameras

### Overview
Before purchasing a security camera, I highly recommended reading Wirecutter’s Best Wi-Fi Home Security Camera for a primer on the latest camera features. It is a very thorough article that I found myself repeating the same advice here before realizing I could save time and link the article! Here is the link again.

I’ll reiterate here some of the features I consider important in a camera: Continuous recording, cloud storage, and reliability.  Cloud storage is a debatable feature as some prefer local storage and privacy for various reasons. I still recommend cloud storage as it is the easiest way to get alerts and view footage remotely. If you don’t mind spending a few weekends maintaining your local camera NVR system, then be my guest.

I tried several of the recommended security cameras listed in Wirecutter’s Guide, but still found myself disappointed with the number of false alerts to review. Face recognition and motion detection technology is still limited, requiring me to adjust camera angle and placement to compensate. 

#### Considerations before buying a camera

- Cloud recording pricing tiers. Every camera has the ability to view live video, but the amount of free recording varies.  Nest is the worst offender, offering only image snapshots. Amazon, Arlo, Logitech and Ring offer reasonable free tiers, ranging from three to 24 hours of recordings, but those tiers can change at any time. 

- Continuous vs. interval recording. Powered cameras like the Nest have no problems recording 24/7 (with a paid subscription), while battery-powered cameras like Blink can only record a snippet when activated.  Considering the heavy reliance on motion detection, I always advise to go for the cameras with continuous recording.

**For the low traffic areas such as the garage, guest bathroom, and closet, I opted for Lutron Maestro Vacancy Sensor Switches, which are simple to install, affordable, and reliable.** Because I like them so much, I always check homes to see where these switches can be installed. Lutron has been making these switches for decades; I’ve seen some Maestro switches in older homes and they continue to function like new. There is little reason to purchase a motion sensor and smart bulb ($40-60) if a $20 vacancy switch can achieve the same effect. 

The built-in motion sensor is very responsive, and turns on the lights faster than any home automated lighting setup. Even in the darkness at 30 feet away, the switch can detect motion. Sensitivity and time length are adjustable, to suit bathrooms and closets that don’t need a high sensitivity. I have not once experienced a time when the bathroom lights turned off while I was showering. 

If you plan to use this in your home, pay attention to the location of the light switch, which is also where the motion sensor is. I couldn’t install this switch in the garage in one house because the light switch in another room! Also, be aware that the switch I linked has a max wattage of 150W and is meant for replacing single-pole switches only. If you plan to replace a 3-way switch or power a series of lights that add up to more than 150W, then you will need the more expensive version.

#### Installation and Smart Home Installation
Installation (for single-pole switches) is as easy as installing a regular light switch—connect the two black wires (doesn’t matter which) and ground to the existing wiring and you’re done. A neutral isn’t required and you don’t have to identify the load and line (hot) wires. The switch size is as small as a regular switch, which makes for the easiest install.

## Dawn-to-dusk Light Bulbs

**Dawn-to-dusk light bulbs like the Philips Dawn-to-Dusk Light bulb work  great as porch lights and donâ€™t use a smart hub.** In my experience, the lights were on when I checked at sunset and off during the daytime. Light bulbs with built-in motion sensors, like the Sengled PAR38 with Motion Sensor may work better if you only need the light to turn on when someone is present. Just make sure the rather large bulb (PAR38) will fit in your light fixture.

Further promoting the case for regular bulbs, some smart bulbs are not meant to be installed outside due to temperature limits, but these dawn-to-dusk bulbs work just fine.

## Remotes

### Philips Hue Remote
You can use the Philips Hue remote and mount on the wall, but for renters, that means you have two light switches on the wall. It looks a little tacky to me.

As a bonus, you can use the Philips Hue remote to factory reset Zigbee light bulbs, specifically reset Hue bulbs into regular Zigbee bulbs to use with SmartThings.

### Amazon Dash Buttons
Using Home Assistant, it’s possible to repurpose the Amazon Dash buttons to do anything you want.  the Hassio add-on is designed to work with ARM-based boards only. Button response time is quite slow, around 3 to 10 seconds, making its uses limited. I use it to turn off all the lights downstairs, or in my room. I don’t mind the few seconds delay.

Range is limited to your wifi network range. Using it as a garage door opener will only work if you are right outside the garage.

Amazon also stopped selling the buttons as of March 2019. You can buy some on eBay if you really want it.

### Lutron Pico Remote
You need the Lutron Pro bridge to get it working locally with Home Assistant. This requirement may change in the future.

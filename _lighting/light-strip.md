## Light Strips (TV, undercabinet lighting)
**Published on: xx/xx/2019**
**Competitors in this space:** Philips Hue, Sylvania Lightify, Yeelight

I personally tested the following:

- Philips Hue Lightstrip Plus 66 Dimmable LED Smart Light Multicolor
- JACKYLED light strip (no longer for sale)

### Overview
Light strips, when used tastefully, can really liven up the home by accentuating less noticeable areas like shelves, cabinets, pantries, and display cases with a warm glow. I love coming back to a perfectly lit home, with accent lighting to show off your prized collections (in my case, some vinyl records). Once automations are in place to set to the appropriate brightness, light strips can also become the gentle lighting to guide your unadjusted eyes through the house late at night. Just make sure not to overdo it and turn your home into a makeshift nightclub. 

I would love to add lightstrips to every part of my house, but my budget is small and I’m limited to installing lightstrips near AC outlets. Light strips aren't as portable as smart bulbs either—the provided adhesive is a one-time use, and it’s difficult splitting the strip into smaller pieces. To keep my lightstrip in one piece, I decided to install one whole strip on a big screen TV, like so.

My personal preference for bias lighting is a warm color temperature, like 2500K, but this Digital Trends article suggests daylight temperature of 6500K and a brightness level of 10% for your eyes to benefit from reduced eye strain. Another cool demonstration of bias lighting is to synchronize the lightstrip color with video using Hue Sync, though it only works with PCs connected to the TV.

There is a plethora of cheaper wireless light strips on Amazon, but there is one theme they have in common: electrical fires. I wasn’t able to find a product with an adequate number of reviews AND a review that didn’t mention a fire. I concluded that the money saved was not worth the risk of fires caused by cheaper, possibly uncertified lighting and decided against purchasing the cheaper light strips.

#### Things to consider before buying a lightstrip

- Light strip placement must be near an AC outlet.
- The length of a lightstrip—do you need to cut the strip to fit?
- Cutting, splitting and extending the lightstrip will require accessories from Litcessory (Amazon seller).

#### What you get with a lightstrip

- Stylish lighting, controlled by automations.
- Gentle lighting to use in the dark.
- Bias lighting for the TV.

If you are looking for professional-level lighting for your cabinets or TV, then the Philips Hue lightstrip is a good but expensive choice, though it is worth the extra money for safe and reliable smart lighting. Like with all Philips Hue products I’ve used, I’m happy with the quality of the lightstrips. The fade effect is present on Hue lightstrips and the transition looks beautiful on a TV. See video below.

#### The Problems
You only get one or two chances to properly mount the lightstrip using the included adhesive—it wears off after the first attempt and peels off quicker wrapping the strip around the TV. If you plan to test on multiple areas, use strong tape to temporarily hold the lightstrip in position until you’re ready to make a decision. 

#### Installation and Smart Home Integration
Pairing lightstrips to the Hue bridge is a simple process I won’t go into detail here. The bridge supports every home automation hub and voice assistant out there. I would guess that it is the most widely supported hub out there, and every aspect of Hue lights is controllable in each of the integrations.

If you’re looking for a way to turn on the light by touch, then I would suggest using the Philips Hue remote. It comes with a wall plate if you want to mount the remote like a light switch.  You can even use a Logitech Harmony hub and remote to control the Hue light strip since there is a Hue integration for that.



#### The Competition
The new Philips Hue Play Light Bar is a better choice for TV bias lighting as it is more portable option but costs even more than a lightstrip. 

After having a good experience using Sylvania OSRAM bulbs, I would try the Sylvania light strips. However, the Amazon reviews are a little worrying—several reviewers noted their strips died after one year. Is it worth paying $40 for potentially one year lifespan?

## Robot Vacuums

I do not own a robot vacuum, but I did watch an informative video review that explained the features found in different price tiered vacuums. I would definitely spend the money to purchase a vacum with some form of smart navigation(cameras, lasers) that can make a map of your room. Otherwise the vacuum will bounce around aimlessly until it gets stuck.

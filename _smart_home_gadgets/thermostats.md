**Competitors in this space: ** Nest, Ecobee, Honeywell, Emerson

I’ve personally tested the following:

- Nest Learning Thermostat (Third Generation) (T3007ES)
- Ecobee4 with Amazon Alexa
- Ecobee3

### Overview
I can count on one hand the number of times my smart thermostat showed its value, but for those times it felt invaluable tool. As I was about to drive home on a cold night after dinner,  I realized I could open the Nest app on my phone and crank up the thermostat temperature. That feeling of entering a warm house after spending hours in the cold is like taking a hot a shower after days of sweaty hiking—it was amazing—the very definition of comfort.

I rarely use a smart thermostat to its full potential, but I can see the value for others. For people who regularly use the furnace, a smart thermostat will warm up the house  at the right times and electricity cost will be slightly less than without a smart thermostat. If you live in a colder climate where chilly nights are frequent, then the thermostat’s value definitely shows. For instance, using a Nest thermostat to heat up the house and prevent pipes from freezing and bursting. If you’re a frugal person who never turns on the thermostat in the first place, then there is no benefit to be gained here.

Smart thermostats like Nest and Ecobee regularly go on sale so it’s easy to snag one at a reasonable price of $170.

#### Considerations Before Buying A Smart Thermostat

- Use the Nest compatibility checker to see if your home’s existing wiring is compatible.~ 
- If you have two thermostats and two separate zones, you may need two smart thermostats. Some furnaces cannot maintain dual temperatures that are too far apart from each other. Having the first floor at 60F and the second floor at 70F may put too much strain on your system.

#### What You Get With a Smart Thermostat

- Warm up or cool down the house before arriving home.
- Forget about adjusting the thermostat—the home/away assist feature turns off the thermostat for you.
- Safety alerts and reminders, like extreme cold weather, to turn on heating.
- Learning specific behaviors, like warming up the house when you wake up.
- Give roommates access via app, if they cannot physically access it.
- Change the thermostat temperature while still in bed.

**I recommend any smart thermostat currently on sale, which is usually the Nest E. It has all important features as the Nest 3rd Gen, but regularly goes on sale for $130 or less.** Get the Nest 3rd Gen if you want a nicer looking, metal finish on your thermostat. Ecobees are just as good, so there is no wrong choice here.

#### Installation and Smart Home Integrations
Installation is not hard, but you need to check with the Nest compatibility checker if your home’s existing wiring is compatible. I had to call tech support because there were more wires than listed in the installation guide. Turns out I just had to ignore those wires!

Physical installation requires some basic DIY skills like drilling holes and basic electrical wiring.

Very rarely do I need to change the temperature, so home automation integration is not all that important to me. I find that using the app is the most convenient way to fiddle with the thermostat. But it is very easy to connect the Nest to Home Assistant. SmartThings requires installation of a device handler, but that’s not too hard.

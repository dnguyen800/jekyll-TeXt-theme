## Indoor Camera
**Published on: xx/xx/2019**
**Competitors in this space:** Nest, ring, wizen, Argo, blink, laview,hikvisiom, Xiaomi, Securitate, Abode,Canary 

I’ve personally tested the following:

- Nest Cam Indoor 
- Wyze Cam v2
- Xiaomi Xiaofang 1080p Camera

### Overview
For privacy reasons, I am very cautious when it comes to the placement of indoor cameras. In my household, we have a camera in the living room that covers all the entry points into the house while avoiding areas where I and my roommates frequent. With the help of presence sensors, I can turn off the camera when someone is at home. My goal is to provide additional security in my home, not invade the privacy of my household members.

Besides using as a pet or baby monitor, cameras can provide visual confirmation of intruders. I wouldn’t make a 911 call based on sensors alone unless the alarm system wasn’t disabled timely. What if I forgot that a relative was stopping by? 

Even if it was only me being recorded on my camera, it doesn’t feel right to be recorded. Maybe that is because there is the possibility of someone other than me viewing the camera footage. Whether it is a rogue IT admin at the company, someone with access to the servers storing the footage, or a hacker who obtained user credentials or exploited a vulnerability on the camera—it is possible that someone can view your footage without permission.

There is a good selection of cameras at different price ranges. My recommendation is to buy one quality camera and one cheap camera to cover your bases. Though if you’re rich, feel free to go nuts with the cameras and spyng.

#### Considerations before buying an indoor camera

- Consider if the camera placement violates any household member’s privacy.
- decide whether you want local or cloud storage features.
- cameras can be battery-powers, or y AC or Ethernet.
- look into the camera’s free video storage tier. Also look into notification features if the camera works locally only.
- security

#### What you get with an indoor camera

- Monitor the garage to ensure the door is closed. Acts as a  Secondary check of who is coming in/out of the garage.
- Monitor pets or babies.
- If a sensor goes off in the house while you’re away, cameras can provide visual verification of intruders.



### Nest Cam Indoor

If you plan to buy only one camera, then get a quality camera that supports continuous recording, like the Nest camera.  Although I talk about Nest often, that doesn’t mean I recommend them to everyone. There are many similar quality cameras that offer better free storage tiers than Nest—start by checking out the Wirecutter’s guide for other recommendations.

The value of Nest cameras is in its ease of setup and use. There are many issues I have using cheaper cameras—router issues, Wi-Fi range, connection dropouts, unreliable cloud servers—but I haven’t run into any of those issues with Nest. Once you have the camera plugged in and the Nest app installed, everything works reasonably well out of the box. The Nest app is also lightning fast at loading live and recorded footage—it takes under 10 seconds to load the app, authenticate and access my cameras. I’ll leave it to users to decide whether the improved experience is worth the premium price of Nest products.

The Nest Aware monthly service used to be the most expensive of the competition, but at the time of this writing,  Nest introduced a $5/month pricing tier. This is much more affordable and I don’t feel as bad anymore when recommending Nest products to customers. Though if you plan on getting a Ring security system, any camera monthly fees are included with the security monitoring fee. 

Nest sends notifications when the camera is offline (due to power outage, or someone unplugging the cord). It’s a nice feature that other companies have.

#### The Problems
There is a Home/away Assist feature on the Nest app, but I found it doesn’t work reliably. There were a few times when I received an alert and opened the app to see my roommate watching TV in the living room. I’ve done my own testing of the feature (Home Assistant integration gives you access to this data) and found it can take hours for Nest to update to Home or Away status. As phones get more aggressive with battery saving, a lot of apps are going to have trouble with presence detection. Unfortunately Nest has not solved this issue either.

Nest’s motion detection algorithm also left me disappointed. I’ve received false alerts from moving window blinds and sunlight piercing through the windows. There are workarounds with camera placement and angle, but I expected more from a Nest camera.

#### Installation and Smart Home Integration
Nest works well with Google Assistant, though there isn’t much need for voice control of a camera, except to broadcast messages or video feeds to a Chromecast. Home Assistant integration works with a Nest developer account, though the Nest camera feed in Home Assistant is only a still image that’s updated every few seconds. It’s better to use the Nest app for viewing footage. Nest detection alerts can be tracked in Home Assistant, though I haven’t found a use for it yet.

### Wyze Cam v2

The Wyze Cam v2 continues to add great value for the price and features it offers—I think everyone should have one as a cheap, spare camera. Originally, I had a slightly negative opinion about this camera, but the slew of new features added in 2018 like continuous and extended event recording, local storage, make it hard not to change my mind. If Wyze ever releases a high quality camera at an affordable price, then I am on board.

Despite using a cheap camera and hardware, Wyze engineers have figured out reasonable workarounds for previous issues like the 12-second recording time, or the five minute cooldown periods between events. Viewing locally stored footage through your cellular network is possible too! As long as you have a compatible micro SD card (and who doesn’t), the Wyze cam will get these features. Homealarmreport.com offers a good, detailed breakdown of the features for those interested.

Motion detection works reasonably well, though it takes some testing to find the right settings. In one example, I setup a Wyze camera in an empty apartment to monitor for break-ins. I wanted to detect any large changes, like the opening of a door, but I was getting false alerts from sunlight and weather changes. I eventually found the right sensitivity settings for my needs, though it took some trial and error.
 
#### The Problems
Without an SD card, the original limitations of the camera are back. Recordings are limited to 10 to 12 seconds, with a five minute cooldown between each alert. The app is a little slower than Nest, and takes longer to load live footage, but compromises had to be made for a $25 camera and these are reasonable.

There is usually a catch when a company offers a camera and free video recordings at an ridiculously low price. Maybe the company plans to convert customers to a subscription model once user base is large enough, or sell certain types of user data to third parties. I’m not aware of Wyze doing anything shady, but it’s important to remember free things come at a cost, which may be your data. The Mozilla Foundation interestingly offers some privacy-focused analysis on the Wyze camera and rates it as “Meets our minimum security standards.”

I generally do not recommend using any Wyze camera custom firmware as you lose existing functionality. I’ve tried hacks on similar cameras (Xiaofang) and found that the loss of features like automatic night vision, cloud, or reliable motion detection wasn’t worth the trade-off.
 
#### Installation and Smart Home Integration
Viewing camera footage in Home Assistant and SmartThings is not a good experience in general—the Wyze app is better for alerts and accessing footage.

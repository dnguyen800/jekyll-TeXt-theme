At a high level, sensors detect a change in the environment and report the details back to the home automation hub.  Whether it is a change in motion, water leak, voltage, someone’s presence, temperature, or an opening of a door—there likely exists a sensor for it. 


You will need door and motion sensors in your home so that the hub can detect activity and respond with an action, like turning on the lights. The sensors communicate using Zigbee or Z-Wave, which your SmartThings hub supports. I prefer to buy Z-Wave sensors as it is the newer technology, but I use a mix of Zigbee and Z-Wave, depending on pricing and quality.  You may have noticed that despite recommending a SmartThings hub, I do not use any SmartThings sensors. That is because nearly all SmartThings sensors have terrible ratings on Amazon! That is too bad—I would have given my money to one company if I could trust the quality of the product.

# Infrastructure

There are several major decisions to be made before you begin purchasing smart devices. I believe choosing the appropriate network infrastructure, home automation hub, smart home wireless standard, and voice assistant is necessary to setting up a reliable smart home. Skipping these decisions will only cause more pain later when you learn that the devices you purchased don’t integrate or start failing for unknown reasons.



No one understood my needs better than me, so I ended up buying every type of hardware until I found the right products. Now I’ll share my findings through this this site. Doing this “research” cost me some change,so I hope you can make use of my recommendations.

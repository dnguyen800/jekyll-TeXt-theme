## Live TV Providers

**Competitors in this space:** Youtube TV, Playstation Vue, Hulu Live, Sling TV, Philo, OTA local channels

I’ve personally  tested the following:

- Youtube TV
- OTA local antenna channels with HDHomerun / Plex Pass
- Sling TV 

### Overview
If you came here hoping for a way to integrate your Xfinity, Verizon, or Dish Network TV receivers with Home Assistant or Amazon Alexa, then you’re out of luck! Those are closed ecosystems and you’re stuck with whatever features they offer. To be fair, the Xfinity app has improved and the Xfinity remote’s voice feature worked well during the times I tried it. If you absolutely refuse to cut the cord with cable TV, then the Logitech Harmony remote can add some voice control and Home Assistant integration, but requires a lot of testing to get it right. To be honest, I haven’t found a reason to use my voice to watch live TV and prefer using a remote to browse through the TV guide or recordings. So you’re not missing much by not integrating.


There are a growing number of video streaming services that offer live local TV and select premium channels for a lower price and no contracts. These integrate services better with voice assistants and Home Assistant by association of the Rokus, Chromecasts and Fire TVs it supports. So lets review one of these services!



#### Considerations Before Purchasing an Internet TV Subscription

- Do you really need another subscription that you may not use? Consider subscribing and canceling when your TV show’s season is over.
- Check your internet provider’s internet speed and bandwidth caps. Your TV watching habits may disrupt another’s video gaming session or exceed bandwidth caps.



#### What You Get With an Internet TV Subscription

- With Youtube TV, share the subscription with five others in your Google Family. You can only change families once a year, and can’t be in more than one family. Geographic restrictions also apply, though in my testing, Bay Area region is fine.
- Watch TV on the go with your phone, even when traveling across states. Eventually these apps block local TV access if it detects you’ve been living in a different area for months.



### Youtube TV

**I tested Youtube TV earlier, and it provides a solid TV viewing experience as well as some useful smart home features, like advanced voice control with Google Assistant.**  Like any good streaming service, Youtube TV supports playback on web browsers, Chromecast, Roku, Apple TV, and most new TVs (2016 models or later). Streaming starts within seconds without any noticeable lag or dropouts, even when watching live sports. The experience convinced me that streaming live TV doesn’t have to suck, unlike my experience with Sling TV.


Voice commands with Google Assistant work really well on Youtube TV (naturally), but only when using Chromecast. Saying “play the latest episode of Conan” works as expected on my Chromecast Ultra, but not on Roku. The most I can do with my voice is say “open Youtube TV on Roku,” which is not all that useful.

#### The Problems
There are some annoyances worth noting before signing up for Youtube TV. Sadly, due to feud between Google and Amazon, Youtube TV does not work with Amazon Fire TV or tablets. Unofficial installation methods exist, but are likely to stop working in a few months whenever an app update is required. 


Secondly, finding and favoriting TV shows should be easy, but the app separates on-demand and broadcast shows, meaning you can’t browse through all of FX’s catalog in one spot. In some cases, I had to search for specific TV shows, like TBS’ Miracle Workers, in order to record them. I’m not able to bookmark Mr. Robot either, at least not until after the season premiere occurs. I also noticed the selection of episodes available on demand fluctuates, much to my annoyance. The shows Angie Tribeca and Final Space on TBS  tends to flip between the first and second half of the latest season every few weeks.


Youtube TV also has a generous family sharing option, allowing up to five additional members to have their own Youtube TV account, with three simultaneous streams each. There are certain limitations, like members can switch families only once a year, you can’t join more than one family. and members should be within a geographic range (unconfirmed as to the range).

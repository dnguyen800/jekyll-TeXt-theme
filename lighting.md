## Lighting

I made the mistake of buying a set of smart bulbs (on sale, of course) without thinking of the lighting options supported in my home.  I assumed that every home needs light bulbs so I would find a place to fit them eventually. Had I done more research and looked into other lighting options, including simple lighting, then I would have a less complicated setup today. My hope is that you will get an understanding of lighting options available and decide the best options for you.

I’ll reiterate that not every light needs to be “smart,” and not everyone can modify their home or apartment. There are options for everyone, though some have more drawbacks. 

If you haven’t decided on a smart home wireless standard yet, then I suggest reading my section on the topic here. Avoid buying the wrong type, as there isn’t any interoperability between standards. 

#### Things to consider when reviewing your house for lighting options

- Is lighting provided by built-in lighting fixtures or lamps?
- Does the lighting fixture use standard light bulbs or integrated lighting?
- What size light bulbs fit in the light fixture? A19 (standard), B10 (chandelier), BR30 (wide), or BR40 (really wide)?
- Are the  light bulbs currently installed also dimmable?
- Are there light switches that control power to wall outlets (for floor lamps)?
- How many lights are connected to one light switch? There is a wattage limit to light switches.
- Is the light switch placed inside or outside the room? If outside, then a motion-sensing switch can’t be used.
